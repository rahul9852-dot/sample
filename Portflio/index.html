                    <p>From Machine learning, we know as human we learn from our Experiences and Machine Learn from data. As M.L Engineer I have worked on both Structured and Unstructured data find meaningful information from their respective Prediction or analysing. I can work On both Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms like Linear Regression , Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression , K-Nearest Neighbour, etc. I can implement all these algorithms in real-world use cases. There is various type of model evaluation technique s where I can work frequently. 
						Apart from Deep learning, I can build a basic neural network model and aware of all math intuition which is used in deep learning.</p>

                    <p>As Data scientist, we know that data science is a multidisciplinary subject which includes lots of process and method which apply on both structured and unstructured data to draw meaningful information from them. As far as my concern I can perform data analysis to gain meaningful information from them. I can also perform Data visualization technique to understand the data and draw various inferences from them. Instead of that, involved various statistical approach to draw an effective conclusion from data. I have implemented various data science technique on real-world uses cases to make ourself effective in a data science discipline.
                        I have also done two Capstone project on real-world data.</p>
